# Introduction #

The Chuon Nath Dictionary is provided in Sdict format which is great for many applications, but it is difficult to find a way to convert the file to another format.  But there is an application you can download for free that makes such a conversion very easy called pyglossary.


# Details #

Download pyglossary from http://code.google.com/p/pyglossary/
You will need python installed to use it (you can get a python installer here: http://www.python.org/download/ )
Once you have installed Python and downloaded the pyglossary file and extracted it, browse to the "src" folder inside the pyglossary directory.  There you will find a file called "ui\_main" which you double click to bring up the conversion dialogue.  Enter in the path of the Chuon Nath .dct file and enter in your conversion specifications.

Then you can have the Chuon Nath dictionary in any format you would like.
